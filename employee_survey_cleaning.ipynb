    "# Employee Exit Survey Data Cleaning\n",
    "In this notebook we'll be working to clean some data consisting of exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training, and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. Our goal will be to combine the two datasets effectively combining similar columns, and handling wrong and null values to make them more workable for further exploration.\n",

    "## Data\n",
    "The *TAFE exit survey* can be found on the Australian .gov.au website [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey). This dataset has quite a few columns, here is a small selection of ones we will be working with:\n",
    "- **Record ID**: An id used to identify the participant of the survey\n",
    "- **Reason for ceasing employment**: The reason why the person's employment ended\n",
    "- **LengthofServiceOverall. Overall Length of Service at Institute (in years)**: The length of the person's employment (in years)\n",

    "- **ID**: An id used to identify the participant of the survey\n",
